 Work out what the top 3 highest scoring anagrams in this list of scrabble words: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjamincrom/scrabble/master/scrabble/dictionary.json
 Scoring is as follows:
 1 Point - A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T and U.
 2 Points - D and G.
 Points - B, C, M and P.
 4 Points - F, H, V, W and Y.
 5 Points - K.
 8 Points - J and X.
 10 Points - Q and Z.
 To be anagram, there must be at least 2 words that have the same letters in the list e.g. in the example below, far is the only word with an f in it, so can't be an anagram of any other word in the list
 The word 'aha' scores 6 as it is A = 1, H = 4 and A = 1 as does 'aah' as it is A = 1, H = 4 and A = 1 and they both have the same letters in them.
 Attempt to balance efficiency with clear code
 It's not an OO structuring question. You don't need to use interfaces.
 It should be a console app
